## time space complexity

### important concepts:
1. growth is with respect to input
2. constants are dropped
3. worst case is usually the way we measure

* bigO trick: if the input halves each step, is likely O(logN) or O(NlogN)

### time complexity of the algorithms that i coded in this repo:
* linear search: O(n)
* binary search: O(logN)

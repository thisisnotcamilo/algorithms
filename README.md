## Time space complexity

### Important concepts:
1. Growth is with respect to input
2. Constants are dropped
3. Worst case is usually the way we measure

* BigO trick: if the input halves each step, is likely O(logN) or O(NlogN)

### Time complexity of the algorithms that i coded in this repo:
* linear search: O(n)
* binary search: O(logN)
